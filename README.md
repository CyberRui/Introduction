## :notebook_with_decorative_cover:About Me
* I am a second-year master student in mathematics department. 

* In the past, I did some project in machine learning (e.g. neural ode) and worked as an Algorithm Assistant Intern. I am intersted in simulation and fascinated by transferring practical problem into mathematical model.

* As for future perspective, I would like to percede my study in mathematics by applying for PhD program and 
## The Motivation Of Studying Causal Inference
* From my perspective, causal inference offers a tool to transform actual models into different causal relationships. With these different logical connections and experimental specific data, we can use computer and mathematical models to simulate and solve practical problems, such as epidemic spread prediction, etc.
